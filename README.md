# online_quiz_website
I took part in a hackathon competition organized by our own college Greater Kolkata College of Engineering and Management.  It was my project for the college hackathon.

# How to run the code
Try running Hone.html file and you will see a basic website for online quiz system.

# How far I work on it 
in this web site, I created 4 quiz section on 4 different topic and added 10 MCQ question in each section. I did create a section for scoring and leadbord where they can see their progress or mask on each topic.

# Scope for improvement
During our hackathon season, we only get 3 days to complete our project so this project need a lot of improvement. Like-
1. I need to work on the designing.
2. I need to add more section in this website like login, a section for adminestater to add question on new topic.
3. And I might also need to work on the backend.

This project have a huge scope, we can make it a online education website like gigs-for-gigs or code ninjas but it going to need a huge time and honestly I am not realy looking forword to it.
